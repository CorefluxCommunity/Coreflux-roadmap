# Coreflux Roadmap üõ£

Welcome to the Coreflux Roadmap repository! This space is where we share the journey of new features from conception to release. Our roadmap is a collaborative space for the community and the Coreflux team to discuss and shape the future of  Coreflux. üöÄ
[See the roadmap ¬ª](https://github.com/orgs/CorefluxCommunity/projects/1)


## Feature Development Stages

Our feature development process includes several stages that a feature goes through from the initial idea to being available for all users:

- **Community Input**: New feature ideas submitted by community members.
- **Consideration**: The Coreflux team reviews and considers the feasibility and impact of the feature.
- **Research**: We conduct thorough research to understand the requirements and implications of the feature.
- **Development**: Our developers start building the feature, transforming ideas into code.
- **Beta**: The feature is released to a limited audience for testing and feedback.
- **Release**: After thorough testing and refinements, the feature is released to all users.
