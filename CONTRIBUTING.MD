# Contributing to Coreflux

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Coreflux! We are excited to have you as part of our community and look forward to your contributions. Whether it's raising a bug report, suggesting a feature, or submitting a pull request, your input is invaluable to us.

Please take a moment to review this document to facilitate the contribution process for everyone.

## Feature Requests

We welcome new feature requests for Coreflux products. If you have an idea that you believe would improve the platform, we encourage you to share it with us.

To suggest a new feature, please use our feature request issue template. This template includes essential questions that help us understand the problem you're addressing and how your suggestion provides a solution. We tag incoming issues from this template to help our team quickly identify and address community recommendations.

Before creating a new feature request, please check the [existing open](https://github.com/CorefluxCommunity/coreflux-roadmap/issues) or [recently closed](https://github.com/CorefluxCommunity/coreflux-roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to avoid duplicates. A single, well-supported issue is easier for us to prioritize and address.

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug within any Coreflux product, please do not use the roadmap repo to report it. Instead, each Coreflux product has its own repository where issues should be raised, as the information needed to address bugs can vary significantly between products.

To report a bug, please use the appropriate repository:
* [Coreflux Central](https://github.com/CorefluxCommunity/coreflux-hub/issues/new/choose)
* [Coreflux Hub](https://github.com/CorefluxCommunity/coreflux-hub/issues/new/choose)
* [Flux Assets](https://github.com/CorefluxCommunity/flux-assets/issues/new/choose)

## Security Issues

If you discover a potential security issue, please do **not** create a public GitHub issue. Instead, send your report privately to security@coreflux.org. Our team will work with you to address the issue responsibly.

## Licensing

Please review the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file in the repository you are contributing to. By submitting a contribution, you agree that your work will be licensed under the same terms.

For significant changes, we may ask you to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to ensure that the community can always use your contributions.

## Code of Conduct

Participation in the Coreflux community is governed by the [Coreflux Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read and adhere to it to foster an inclusive and friendly environment.
